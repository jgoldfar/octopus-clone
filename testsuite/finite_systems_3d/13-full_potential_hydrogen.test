# Calculation of a Hydrogen atom placed on a very small magnetic field (in order
# to get orbitals with the proper symmetry). The electron is placed on the p_{-1}
# orbital; this orbital has non-null current, and it produces a current flow
# through the x=0,y>0 half plane.
#
# The (analytical) values of these kind of flows in one-electron atoms are
# provided in I. Barth and J. Manz, Phys. Rev. A 75, 012510 (2007). The number
# calculated by the test corresponds with the value given in Eq. 14 for Z = 1,
# that is, in atomic units, I = 1/(16*pi) = 0.01989 a.u. ( = 0.132 mA).
#
# The run also calculates the induced magnetic field, by making use of the
# Biot-Savart law. The value provided in the paper is 0.52 T, corresponding
# to .00030 atomic units.
#
# The presence of the small magnetic field increases the value of the current
# slightly. Other sources of error with respect to the analytical paper are the
# approximation of the full potential, finite domain, and discrete grid.
