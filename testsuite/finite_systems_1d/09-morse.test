Test       : Morse potential
Program    : pulpito
TestGroups : short-run, finite_systems_1d
Enabled    : Yes

# This test replicates one of the calculations reported in the paper:
# [G. K. Paramonov, Chem. Phys. 177, 169 (1993)]
#
# The calculation corresponds with the ones presented in Fig. 1
# (panels C and D).
#
# It consists of the calculation of the evolution of the nuclear wavepacket
# of an OH bond in a water molecule, modeled with the Morse potential.
